      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hi—welcome to my little corner of the Internet, where I compose music. My name is Ben, and I go by BenGurWaves. I'm a 16-year-old self-funded artist who began this journey at the very start of 2025, pouring time, energy, and heart into every piece I create.</p>
      <p>Music has always been part of me. I started playing piano at six, and over the years picked up guitar, violin, and more. I was always surrounded by melody—my childhood was full of sound, and I wrote my first original track, Crystal Waterfalls, at just nine years old.</p>
      <p>This is a one-person operation: I write, arrange, and produce everything myself—just me, a piano, a computer, and whatever emotion flows through my fingers that day.</p>
      <p>Big thanks to my cousin, who handles all the visuals and video editing. Together, we bring these songs to life across YouTube, Instagram, Rumble, Vimeo, Threads, and beyond.</p>
      <p>If you'd like to support what I do, it truly means the world. But more than anything, I hope the music gives you a moment of stillness, inspiration, or clarity.</p>
      <p>"All glory be to God. I am nothing without Him, and my music is nothing either. May God be praised through my music and through me."</p>
