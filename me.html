      <!-- About Me (each paragraph has fade-in for reveal on scroll) -->
      <section class="hero">
        <h1 class="fade-in">About Me</h1>
        <p class="fade-in">Hi — I’m Ben, aka <strong>BenGurWaves</strong>. I’m 16, self-funded, and stubborn enough to call music my life’s work. This isn’t a hobby I do between school and snacks. It’s the way I make sense of the world, the way I breathe when everything else gets loud.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="fade-in">Early life & musical roots</h2>
        <p class="fade-in">Piano found me at six. I moved through teachers until one of them introduced me to the Royal Conservatory — slow, steady lessons that taught me discipline and love for detail. Ten years later, I’m still learning and still hungry to make sound that matters.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="fade-in">Saxophone</h2>
        <p class="fade-in">I picked up sax in third grade with the school orchestra. I kept at it, trained with a coach who pushed my phrasing and tone, and the sax became a voice I return to when I want breath, bend, and lines that speak like a person.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="fade-in">Family & roots</h2>
        <p class="fade-in">Music wasn’t an “activity” in my house — it was background noise and celebration. Parents, grandparents, and even great-grandparents played. I didn’t exactly choose music; I was raised in it. That inheritance is messy, loud, and tender — and I’m grateful for it.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="fade-in">Guitar</h2>
        <p class="fade-in">Guitar came later. I studied with a few teachers and put years into practice. I mostly play for myself now, but nylon-guitar pieces will show up in future releases when the arrangement asks for that intimacy.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="fade-in">Violin</h2>
        <p class="fade-in">Violin was a challenge I chased because my sister played. Two to three years of fiddly practice taught me patience: bow control, small adjustments, and the stubbornness to keep showing up after squeaks and missed notes. I didn’t master it — but I learned how to keep going when progress is slow.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="fade-in">My four main instruments</h2>
        <p class="fade-in"><strong>Piano · Saxophone · Guitar · Violin</strong></p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="fade-in">The push (and the pause)</h2>
        <p class="fade-in">When I started releasing music I lied to myself about the motives. I told myself it wasn’t about the numbers — but it was. I was running a weekly sprint that left me exhausted and scraping for momentum. Summer 2025 changed that: I paused, studied the craft properly — writing, mixing, producing — and began to accept that growth is endless and slow.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="fade-in">How I write</h2>
        <p class="fade-in">Piano is my home base — the clearest way I hear ideas. Some songs begin as a single line, others as a chord or a rhythm. I chase feeling first; technique is the tool that helps the feeling stand up and be understood.</p>
        <p class="fade-in">I listen to people who build space and atmosphere — Hans Zimmer, Gibran Alcocer, Tony Anderson, Jordan Critz — and try to plant my own small lights in that dark. I want to reach that level of depth, not for clout, but because that kind of music shapes people.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="fade-in">Faith & honesty</h2>
        <p class="fade-in">My faith guides me, but I’m not perfect. I stumble. I make terrible mixes. I mess up in front of people. The music is how I work through it — the doubt, the joy, the question, the praise. I give credit where it’s due, and still stay real: I fail, I laugh, I try again.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="fade-in">Life off the grid</h2>
        <p class="fade-in">I like solitude, long walks in nature, and quiet rooms for composing. Big crowds aren’t my vibe — I’d pick a late night of writing over a party. But put me with a close friend for an afternoon and I’ll trade the studio for laughter and terrible jokes any day.</p>
        <p class="fade-in">Thank you for taking a minute to read this. I hope the music gives you a place to breathe.</p>
        <p class="fade-in"><em>"All glory be to God. I am nothing without Him, and my music is nothing either."</em></p>
