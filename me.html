  <h1 class="fade-in">About Me</h1>

  <p class="fade-in">
    Hi — I’m Ben, aka <strong>BenGurWaves</strong>. I’m 16, self-funded, and stubborn enough to call music my life’s work.
    This isn’t a hobby I do between school and snacks. It’s the way I make sense of the world, the way I breathe when everything else gets loud.
  </p>

  <h2 class="fade-in">Early life & musical roots</h2>

  <p class="fade-in">
    Piano found me at six. I moved through teachers until one of them introduced me to the Royal Conservatory — slow, steady, exacting
    lessons that taught me discipline and love for detail. Ten years later, I’m still learning, still hungry, and still trying to
    translate feeling into sound.
  </p>

  <h2 class="fade-in">Saxophone</h2>

  <p class="fade-in">
    I picked up sax in third grade when the school orchestra dragged me in (in the best way). I kept at it, worked with a coach who
    pushed my phrasing and tone, and the sax became a voice I return to when I want breath, bend, and phrasing that talks like a person.
  </p>

  <h2 class="fade-in">Family & roots</h2>

  <p class="fade-in">
    Music isn’t an interest in my house — it’s the language. Parents, grandparents, even great-grandparents made noise and harmony before me.
    I didn’t choose music so much as inherit it. That inheritance is messy, loud, tender, and I’m grateful for every note.
  </p>

  <h2 class="fade-in">Guitar</h2>

  <p class="fade-in">
    Guitar came later. I tried a few teachers and ended up with years of focused practice — not to show off, but because I like the
    way nylon strings change a song’s mood. Right now I play mostly to myself, but I’ll fold guitar into releases when the piece needs
    that warm, intimate voice.
  </p>

  <h2 class="fade-in">Violin</h2>

  <p class="fade-in">
    Violin was a challenge I chased because my sister played and I like things other people call “impossible.” Two, maybe three years of
    fiddly practice taught me patience: bow control, small adjustments, and the stubbornness to keep showing up after squeaks and missed notes.
    I didn’t master it — not even close — but I learned how to sit with slow progress and not quit. That stubbornness shows up everywhere now.
  </p>

  <h2 class="fade-in">My four main instruments</h2>

  <p class="fade-in"><strong>Piano · Saxophone · Guitar · Violin</strong></p>

  <h2 class="fade-in">The push (and the pause)</h2>

  <p class="fade-in">
    When I started releasing music I lied to myself about why I was doing it. I told myself it wasn’t about the numbers — but it was.
    I was running a weekly sprint: record, scramble to mix, post a teaser, upload, release. I was burning out, chasing momentum.
    Summer 2025 changed everything. I hit pause, learned the craft properly — writing, mixing, producing — and realized growth doesn’t
    end. It just keeps asking for more patience.
  </p>

  <h2 class="fade-in">How I write</h2>

  <p class="fade-in">
    Piano is my home base — the clearest way I hear ideas. But I don’t fence myself to one instrument: some songs start as a chord, others
    as a rhythm, sometimes as a single line of melody on sax. I don’t obsess over theory first; I chase feeling. The technical stuff comes
    after, to shape what the heart already said.
  </p>

  <p class="fade-in">
    I’m inspired by people who make music feel like landscape: Hans Zimmer, Gibran Alcocer, Tony Anderson, Jordan Critz. I listen to how they
    build space and atmosphere, then try to plant my own small lights inside that dark. I want to get there — not for clout, but because that
    kind of depth is what I’m reaching for.
  </p>

  <h2 class="fade-in">Faith & honesty</h2>

  <p class="fade-in">
    My faith shapes how I move, but I’m not a caricature of perfect. I stumble. I make terrible mixes. I mess up in front of people.
    The music is how I work through it — the doubt, the joy, the question, the praise. I give credit where it’s due, but I’m also real:
    I fail, I laugh, I try again.
  </p>

  <h2 class="fade-in">Life off the grid</h2>

  <p class="fade-in">
    I like solitude, long walks in nature, and quiet rooms for composing. Big crowds aren’t my vibe — I’d pick a late night of writing over a party.
    But put me with a close friend for an afternoon and I’ll trade the studio for laughter and terrible jokes any day. Travel, silence, and
    real conversation feed the songs I want to write.
  </p>

  <p class="fade-in">
    Thank you for listening — for taking a minute to read my messy, honest story. I hope the music gives you a place to breathe.
    That’s the goal, always.
  </p>
